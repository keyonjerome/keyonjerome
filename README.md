### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

_I dissected an iris today. It was an eye-opening experience._

My name's Keyon. Iâ€™m a UWaterloo Mechatronics Engineering student, technology enthusiast, and professional dad-joke maker. I have a dad joke app installed on my phone, and I'm pretty sure terrible jokes are the only reason I passed my high-school drivers' test.

*I'm currently looking for Winter 2022 internship opportunities in backend or embedded systems development.*

Feel free to check out any of my pinned repositories for info about my coolest projects. If you'd like to get in touch, send me an email at keyonjerome@gmail.com, or a LinkedIn message!
